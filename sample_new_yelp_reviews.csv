CF33F8-E6oudUQ46HnavjQ,Sonic Drive-In,Terrible! No customer service what so ever. We sat and waited for an order to be placed. They never answered with the button pushed. We said something to one of the car hops and said that one wasn't working.  No sign placed on there. He didn't offer to take our order or any help what do ever.,1
SwWfW3vBn5QkDE7T3urGAg,Persis Biryani Indian Grill,"Finally tried this tonight for dinner. We love Indian food! And this one just became one of our favorite. Having just recently moved from Orlando, we love finding great places to eat at our new hometown. The butter chicken is soo good. The Gobi 65 is aahhhmazing with just the right amount of heat. And the Rasmalai - my favorite!! We'll be back for sure.",5
lWPQeVAZInbNntRu6eFkbg,Louisiana Pizza Kitchen,"This place was awful. The service was ok, our waiter seemed totally bored and was not very helpful. I had the artichoke ravioli which was terrible. The pesto sauce it was in was NOT pesto. It was greasy olive oil, and did not taste good. The artichoke was also significantly over cooked. Had the espresso cupcake for dessert...which was dry. And then when I went to the bathroom the door was right next to where the dishes are washed, and the door was fairly see through. So awkward. The guy washing the dishes was nice though and said ""If you're gonna pay money to eat here, I want to make sure you eat on a very clean plate!"" Which was nice to hear.

I wouldn't come back here. Just not a very pleasant experience. Mr. Dishwasher was the highlight of the night.",1
fMOVZ-u5IqfJ-lNOCLVm7g,Gin Korean BBQ,Yessss!! Finally a kbbq in New Orleans worth going to! You get a lot of meat on a plate for a good price. Everything was very flavorful! Went on grand opening night so they ran out of a few dishes that I wanted to try but I definitely will be coming back! Staff was nice and quick too.,5
