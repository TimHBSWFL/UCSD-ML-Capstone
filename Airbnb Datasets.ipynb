Although a quiet neighborhood, please make sure to lock the doors when you are in and out. I suggest keeping the key in the lockbox, so you do not lose it when at the beach or if there are multiple people. There are great parks to walk to in each direction of the house. You can also walk to the beach if you follow the lake around all the way it will take you to the sidewalk that goes over the bridge and the ocean is right there. Parking at the beach can be hard, but there are garages for $10 a day (at least that's what it used to be). This is a duplex and the tenants work, so please be</td>\n",

And not to mention Hard Rock casino within 10 mins distance, if you are feeling lucky ;)  We also had a nice welcome wine waiting for us :) \\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;The house was very spacious, with 3 big rooms and a nice lawn.
